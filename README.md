The DIST file contains the EXE file, the file for filling in the keys "keys.docx" and the file with the table with the results "result.docx". After running the EXE file you will be asked to insert the path to your PDF file with several documents which in turn should be separated by a special mark in the form of text - "End" (i.e. on the last page of a certain document should be indicated this inscription, preferably not too small). After the program notices the mark, this sheet will be considered the last of the document and the next PDF sheet will be considered the beginning of the next document, etc. As the program works, you will see logs in the console that provide information about the progress of the program (whether and what keywords were found, the dates found, the number of processed sheets, etc.). After the end of work the file result.docx will contain the results you need. It is very important not to change the name of columns in tables and their name (File name) otherwise the program will lose the path to them.
